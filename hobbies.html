  <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Techonology: My first explorations into technology began with small
      electrical engineering projects with my Dad, and it has slowly evolved into
      software and web development, as I have begain to try to utilize my time on the computer
      for growth rather than video games. Learning software has turned into an itch that I
      never want to stop scratching.</li>
    <li>Family Time: I love spending time with my wife, daughter, cat, and dog.</li>
    <li>Powerlifting: I love to exercise, but more for strength than anything else.</li>
    <li>Fishing: It is hard to find time to fish much more, but when I do get the chance,
      I like to fly fish a nice calm river.</li>
    <li>Woodworking: I am not that good, but I enjoy the pressure of working with wood.
      One misstep and you have to startover. It has taught me great patience.</li>
    <li>Cooking: I love cooking everything from paella to green curry from scratch.</li>
  </ol>
